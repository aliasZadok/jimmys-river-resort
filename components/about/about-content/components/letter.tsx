        <br/>
        <br/>
          I am writing this letter to you from my desk overlooking the &apos;Ravi&apos; river, 
          where the morning mist is just starting to lift and the mountains are beginning 
          to uncover their faces.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          After having served for more than three decades in the Indian Army and lived in more than a dozen military stations across India, 
          I have learned that true happiness is not about marble floors or fancy amenities –– it is about finding a space where your soul can breathe. 
          Personally, my most cherished memories involve the time spent in some remote areas, where life stripped down to its bare & beautiful essentials.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As an &apos;army family&apos;, we have literally packed our lives into steel trunks, wooden boxes and cartons every two years, 
          watching our belongings being loaded onto weathered Tata trucks with &quot;Horn OK Please&quot; painted on their backs, 
          the tarpaulins carefully tied down for journeys across the country –– an adventure that taught us the art of creating a home-away-from-home, 
          no matter where we went!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          That is why when I finally hung up my boots, I knew I needed to build a haven for souls seeking refuge from the chaos of city life. 
          A place so tranquil, one could hear their own thoughts. Where the sound of the rushing river engulfs the stillness of the night 
          and where the only pinging sound in the morning would be of birds chirping to greet every new day!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My wife Hemant and I have poured our hearts into creating a place that feels less like a hotel and more like the warm, 
          welcoming home we always had during our nomadic days.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Here, you shall not find any tourist traps –– instead, you will discover the joy of long conversations, reading a book in serenity, 
          finding the right spot for spending the day fishing, drawing landscapes or watching eagles soar high over the hills, 
          savouring home-cooked meals, gazing at a million stars or simply appreciating the clean air that rejuvenates us!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We would be delighted to assist you in planning a local sightseeing trip to Chamba town, which boasts of palaces, 
          &apos;Chaugan&apos; and some temples dating as far back as the 10th century. Other places of interest involving a day-trip include 
          a visit to &apos;Kalatop&apos; Wildlife Sanctuary, Chamera Dam, Khajjiar Lake and Saach Pass. We shall also share with you some lesser 
          known spots in Chamba –– places that don&apos;t make it to tourist guides but hold the real magic of these ancient hills!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          So, whether you are an adventurer looking to explore hidden trails, a family seeking quality time together, 
          or a couple in need of peaceful reconnection –– I promise you will rediscover your rhythm here, just as we found ours!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If this resonates with you, if you are seeking not just a stay but a return to what matters most, 
          then consider this as my personal invitation to experience the Chamba we know and love!
          <br/>
